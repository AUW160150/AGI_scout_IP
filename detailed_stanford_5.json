This advancement enables more accurate preclinical testing in immunocompetent models, improving the predictive value of studies and reducing clinical trial failures.",
        "abstract": "CAR-T cell therapies have been successful in treating blood cancers, but their efficacy in solid tumors has been limited. Traditional preclinical development often involves testing human CAR-T cells against human tumors in immunocompromised mouse models, which do not accurately predict clinical performance due to the lack of a complex tumor immune microenvironment. This limitation has led to mixed results for solid tumor CAR-T therapies, including early B7H3-targeting approaches that showed limited efficacy and adverse events. B7H3 is a promising pan-cancer target, highly expressed across multiple solid tumor types with minimal expression in healthy tissues. However, existing B7H3 CAR-T cells lack species cross-reactivity, hindering meaningful preclinical testing in immunocompetent models. By engineering B7H3-targeting CAR-T cells with species cross-reactivity through directed evolution, researchers developed variants maintaining high affinity for both human and mouse B7H3. Preclinical studies demonstrated effective tumor control in both human and mouse models, with superior in vivo performance and no observed toxicity at high doses. This species cross-reactive approach has the potential to significantly improve preclinical testing accuracy, reduce development risks, and enhance the clinical translation success of B7H3-targeting CAR-T therapies across multiple solid tumor types.",
        "benefit": "The cross-reactive B7H3-targeting CAR-T cells enable testing in immunocompetent models that better predict clinical outcomes, allow the use of a single CAR sequence from preclinical development through clinical trials, exhibit a superior safety profile with no observed toxicity at high doses, and reduce development risk while improving clinical translation potential compared to existing B7H3 CAR approaches.",

        "summary": "Stanford scientists have developed a method to selectively expand CAR-T cells by co-delivering IL9R with CAR genes using a novel platform that enables rapid CAR-T cell engineering through targeted lentiviral delivery. This approach promotes selective expansion of engineered T cells through IL9 cytokine treatment, eliminating the need for traditional lymphodepletion procedures and achieving enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.",
        "abstract": "Current CAR-T cell manufacturing processes require lymphodepletion prior to infusion to promote CAR-T cell engraftment and expansion in patients. While lymphodepletion creates a favorable microenvironment for CAR-T cell activation and proliferation, it puts patients at significant risk of infections and cytopenia due to the depletion of normal immune cells. Additionally, emerging rapid CAR-T manufacturing platforms enable in vivo engineering but face significant challenges. These approaches cannot utilize traditional lymphodepletion methods, as this would eliminate the T cells targeted for engineering, and the rapid in vivo modification process produces relatively low numbers of CAR-positive T cells compared to conventional manufacturing. Therefore, a method to selectively expand engineered T cells while promoting optimal anti-tumor signaling is essential for successful in-vivo CAR-T cell therapy. Co-delivering IL9R with CAR genes enables selective expansion of engineered T cells through treatment with IL9, a naturally orthogonal cytokine that specifically targets cells expressing the co-delivered receptor. This approach promotes optimal JAK/STAT signaling for enhanced T cell proliferation and anti-tumor function without affecting non-engineered cells. In preclinical studies, CAR-T cells co-delivered with IL9R demonstrated significantly enhanced expansion and anti-tumor potency compared to CAR alone in leukemia models. Consequently, IL9R co-delivery has the potential to overcome the key limitations of rapid in vivo CAR-T manufacturing by enabling selective expansion without requiring lymphodepletion, offering a safer and more effective approach to CAR-T cell therapy.",
        "benefit": "Eliminates the need for dangerous lymphodepletion procedures, enables selective expansion of only engineered T cells through orthogonal cytokine signaling, significantly increases CAR-T cell numbers compared to rapid manufacturing alone, promotes optimal anti-tumor JAK/STAT signaling profile, compatible with both in vivo and ex vivo manufacturing approaches, reduces patient risk of infections and cytopenia.",
        "market_application": "Selective expansion of CAR-T cells in vivo without lymphodepletion, enhanced ex vivo CAR-T manufacturing with reduced timelines, treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors requiring high CAR-T cell numbers or treatment of autoimmune diseases responsive to CAR-T cells, development of safer CAR-T therapies with reduced infection risk.",
