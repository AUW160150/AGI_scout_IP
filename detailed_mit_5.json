        "summary": "This technology presents a method for purifying full capsids of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors from mixtures containing both full and empty capsids. Utilizing a preferential crystallization strategy, it achieves over 90% purity in a single, low-shear step, offering a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional purification methods.",

After incubation, the full capsid crystals are separated, effectively purifying them from empty capsids. These purified crystals can be stored and later reconstituted for use in gene therapy treatments.",
        "benefit": "Key benefits include a simple crystallization method achieving over 90% concentration of full capsids, a lower cost and scalable approach compared to current purification options, the ability to produce concentrated, stable intermediates for easier storage and transport, reduced patient immune responses by minimizing empty capsid load, and adaptability to purify multiple rAAV serotypes.",
